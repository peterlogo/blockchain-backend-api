## Thresholds and Key Metrics

### Thresholds (Not Met)

- **HTTP Request Duration (`http_req_duration`):**  
  - **Threshold:** p(95) should be less than 1,000ms.  
  - **Observed p(95):** 59.99 seconds.  
  
- **HTTP Request Failures (`http_req_failed`):**  
  - **Threshold:** Failure rate should be less than 2% (rate < 0.02).  
  - **Observed Rate:** 52.73% (887 out of 1,682 requests failed).

### Total HTTP Metrics

- **Request Duration:**
  - **Average:** 20.75 seconds  
  - **Minimum:** 0 ms  
  - **Median:** 684.25 ms  
  - **Maximum:** 60 seconds  
  - **90th Percentile:** 59.99 seconds  
  - **95th Percentile:** 59.99 seconds  
  
  _Note:_ The expected responses had an **average response time of 6.48 seconds**, but in the worst cases, response times peaked at **33.16 seconds**.

- **HTTP Requests:**
  - **Total Count:** 1,682 requests, with an average throughput of **8 RPS**.

- **HTTP Failures:**
  - **Failure Rate:** 52.73% of requests failed.

### Execution and Network Metrics

- **Iterations:**
  - **Total:** 1,094 successful iterations, averaging 5.2 iterations per second.
  - **Dropped Iterations:** 16,858 (due to high latency and failures).

- **Network:**
  - **Data Received:** 42 MB (~202 kB/s)
  - **Data Sent:** 160 kB (~761 B/s)

## Analysis

- **Severe Latency Issues:**
  - The 95th percentile response time of **59.99 seconds** is significantly above the expected 1s threshold.
  - While some requests complete in under 1 second, a majority are experiencing major slowdowns.

- **High Failure Rate:**
  - Over **52% of requests failed**, which is unacceptable for production.
  - Failures may indicate server overload, poor database performance, or rate-limiting.

- **Resource Constraints and Scalability Issues:**
  - High dropped iteration count (16,858) suggests the system is rejecting or timing out requests under heavy load.
  - Potential bottlenecks in the database, API layer, or infrastructure limits.

## Recommendations

1. **Optimize Database Queries:**
   - Identify slow queries and optimize them using indexing or caching.
   - Ensure database connection pooling is properly configured to handle concurrent requests.

2. **Improve API Performance:**
   - Review the `/transactions` endpoint for potential inefficiencies.
   - Use asynchronous processing to prevent blocking operations.
   - Implement paginated responses if returning large datasets.

3. **Increase Server Resources:**
   - Upgrade hardware or allocate more resources (CPU, memory, connections).
   - Use horizontal scaling with multiple instances and load balancing.

4. **Refine Load Testing Approach:**
   - Gradually ramp up traffic instead of starting with 100 RPS instantly.
   - Identify failure points with different load levels.

5. **Enhance Error Handling:**
   - Implement proper timeout handling and retries for failed requests.
   - Ensure detailed logging to diagnose failure causes.

## Conclusion

This test highlights critical performance bottlenecks in the `/transactions` endpoint. Immediate optimizations are required to **reduce latency**, **increase request success rates**, and **ensure scalability** under load. Addressing database performance, server capacity, and API efficiency will be key to improving system reliability.
