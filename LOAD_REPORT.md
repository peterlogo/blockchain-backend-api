## Thresholds and Key Metrics

### Thresholds (Not Met)

- **HTTP Request Duration (`http_req_duration`):**  
  - **Threshold:** p(95) should be less than 500ms.  
  - **Observed p(95):** 59.99 seconds.
  
- **HTTP Request Failures (`http_req_failed`):**  
  - **Threshold:** Failure rate should be less than 1% (rate < 0.01).  
  - **Observed Rate:** 10.97% (93 out of 847 requests failed).

### Total HTTP Metrics

- **Request Duration:**
  - **Average:** 6.94 seconds  
  - **Minimum:** 506.4 µs  
  - **Median:** 46.68 ms  
  - **Maximum:** 1 minute  
  - **90th Percentile:** 59.49 seconds  
  - **95th Percentile:** 59.99 seconds
  
  _Note:_ When evaluating expected responses, the average duration was 421.47 ms, but in the worst cases, response times peaked near 1 minute.

- **HTTP Requests:**
  - **Total Count:** 847 requests, with an average throughput of 10.69 requests per second.

- **HTTP Failures:**
  - **Failure Rate:** 10.97% of requests failed.

### Execution and Network Metrics

- **Iteration Duration:**
  - **Average:** 13.69 seconds  
  - **Minimum:** 1.01 seconds  
  - **Median:** 1.15 seconds  
  - **Maximum:** 1 minute 1 second

- **Iterations:**  
  - **Total:** 440 iterations, averaging 5.56 iterations per second.

- **Network:**
  - **Data Received:** 72 MB (approximately 909 kB/s)
  - **Data Sent:** 100 kB (approximately 1.3 kB/s)

## Analysis

- **High Latency:**  
  The 95th percentile for HTTP request duration is at 59.99 seconds, which is far above the threshold of 500ms. This indicates that while some requests complete quickly, the worst-case response times are unacceptably high.

- **Significant Failure Rate:**  
  With an observed failure rate of 10.97%, nearly 11% of requests are not succeeding. This is a major concern that suggests either the server is overwhelmed or there is an error in the endpoint’s handling of requests under load.

- **Inconsistent Performance:**  
  While the expected response times (when requests do succeed) are within a reasonable range (e.g., average around 421.47ms for expected responses), the overall average is much higher due to outliers. The wide gap between median and 95th percentile indicates performance inconsistency.

- **Resource and Scaling Considerations:**  
  The data indicates that the system is likely struggling with resource allocation under load. High VU counts (up to 100) may be contributing to delays and failures, and the application or its dependencies (such as the database) might not be scaling as needed.

## Recommendations

1. **Review and Optimize the Endpoint Code:**
   - Analyze the `/transactions` endpoint for any blocking operations or inefficient code paths.
   - Ensure that asynchronous operations are properly implemented to avoid unnecessary delays.

2. **Database Optimization:**
   - Investigate the underlying database queries for inefficiencies.
   - Consider adding indexes, optimizing queries, or implementing caching mechanisms to improve response times.

3. **Increase Resource Allocation:**
   - Evaluate if the server has sufficient resources (CPU, memory, connection limits) to handle the load.
   - Consider horizontal scaling with load balancing to distribute the load more effectively.

4. **Adjust Load Testing Parameters:**
   - Gradually ramp up the load to identify the breaking point rather than targeting a high RPS immediately.
   - Monitor which specific request patterns or volumes lead to failure.

5. **Error Handling and Timeouts:**
   - Review and adjust timeout configurations both at the application level and any upstream load balancers or proxies.
   - Implement more robust error handling to provide meaningful feedback when failures occur.

## Conclusion

The load test reveals critical performance bottlenecks at the `/transactions` endpoint, with a 95th percentile response time nearing 60 seconds and an unacceptable failure rate of nearly 11%. These results suggest a need for immediate optimization of the endpoint and underlying systems, including code optimization, database tuning, resource scaling, and improved error handling.
